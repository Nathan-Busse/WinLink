# Winux
Inspired from [winapps](https://github.com/winapps-org/winapps)

Winux shares the same idea as winapps however the key difference is that winux focuses on beginner linux users, light weight performance and a automated and streamlined setup GUI as you would when setting up linux distros such as Raspberry OS Desktop.

My intention is not to rip  off winapps but simply to unlock its full potential to all users no matter there linux expereince.

I also want to make Office accessible to linux users without a hypervisor but rather a container and  access the office suite as though it were native to the Linux OS of choice.
